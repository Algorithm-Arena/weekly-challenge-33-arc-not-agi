# Weekly Challenge #33 - ARC not AGI

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that solves 3 [ARC-AGI problems](https://arcprize.org/play?task=09629e4f) of your choosing.** I've been fascinated by the ARC-AGI challenge that is giving 1 million dollars if you're able to create a program that solves 100 private puzzles, they share the same structure as 800 puzzles that are public. I started [live streaming solving the 800 puzzles](https://twitter.com/Vjeux/status/1826273041283965018) and I figured it may be a good challenge :)
